# Access Logs

Pods provide two types of logs:

- **Container Logs**: These include anything typically sent to your console standard out.
- **System Logs**: These include information on your container's formation and current status, such as download, extraction, start, and stop events.

## Viewing Logs

To access your logs:

1. Navigate to the **Pods Dashboard**.
2. Click the **Logs** button on your Pod.

This will display both container and system logs, helping you monitor and debug your Pod's performance effectively.
