## QA

### 1. Q: How is cloud service compliance ensured?
A: We provide a cloud platform service model with a compute resource pool offering hybrid cloud services. Customer isolation and sensitive operation restrictions are implemented.

### 2. Q: What is the revenue model and distribution?
A: We adopt three distribution models: Serverless, Pod, and Idle Mining. Assuming the base income is X, the Serverless model generates 2X income; the Pod model generates X income; and the Idle Mining model generates 0.5X income. These three models ensure stable and reliable device income.

### 3. Q: What are the methods for resource hosting and release?
A: We currently use flexible hosting, allowing withdrawal at any time, making it convenient to coordinate device hosting and release as needed.

### 4. Q: How is revenue clarity and division ensured?
A: We use AB accounts for billing representation. The A account is the company account, which can view all income and device statuses. The B account is the personal account, which can view all data from the company account as well as personal profit income and detailed billing information.
