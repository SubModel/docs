## What are Pods?

Pods enable you to run your code on GPU instances using containers.

Our GPUs are hosted exclusively in T3/T4 certified data centers, guaranteeing enterprise-grade reliability and security infrastructure. 

## What is Serverless?

Serverless provides pay-per-second serverless computing with autoscaling capabilities for your production environment.

Define a Worker, create a REST API Endpoint for it, queue jobs, and enjoy autoscaling to meet demand. This service ensures low cold-start times and robust security measures.
