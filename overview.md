# Overview

Submodel.ai is a cloud computing platform tailored for AI, machine learning applications, and general computing needs.

Utilize our platform to execute your code using both GPU and CPU resources through our [Pods](pods/overview.md) and [Serverless](serverless/overview.md) computing options.

## What are Pods?

Pods enable you to run your code on GPU and CPU instances using containers.

Pods are available in two types: Secure Cloud and Community Cloud. Secure Cloud operates in T3/T4 data centers, ensuring high reliability and security. Community Cloud connects individual compute providers to consumers through a vetted, secure peer-to-peer system.

## What is Serverless?

Serverless provides pay-per-second serverless computing with autoscaling capabilities for your production environment.

Define a Worker, create a REST API Endpoint for it, queue jobs, and enjoy autoscaling to meet demand. This service, part of our Secure Cloud offering, ensures low cold-start times and robust security measures.
